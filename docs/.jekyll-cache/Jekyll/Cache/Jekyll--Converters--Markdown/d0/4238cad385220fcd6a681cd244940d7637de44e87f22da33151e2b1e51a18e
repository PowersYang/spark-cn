<ul>
  <li>In Spark 3.0, Structured Streaming forces the source schema into nullable when file-based datasources such as text, json, csv, parquet and orc are used via <code>spark.readStream(...)</code>. Previously, it respected the nullability in source schema; however, it caused issues tricky to debug with NPE. To restore the previous behavior, set <code>spark.sql.streaming.fileSource.schema.forceNullable</code> to <code>false</code>.</li>
</ul>
